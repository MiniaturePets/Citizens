# Citizens Integration
## (Requires Miniature Pets & Citizens)
### This is the simple integration between Citizens and Miniature Pets, it's completely open source!

#### Installation
Place the citizens-integration-x.x.jar file in the plugins/ directory
Make sure to have Citizens 2.0.0 or higher installed, along with the latest version of Miniature Pets

#### Usage & Permissions
Being a completely seperate plugin, we though it could be less confusing to just include this in here.

- `/pet npc [title] [pet]`
  - **Description** Spawns a Citizens NPC, all interactions are to be made through Citizens itself.
  - **Permission Node** miniaturepets.npc
