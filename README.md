# Citizens Integration
This is the simple integration between Citizens and Miniature Pets, which allows administrators to spawn NPC's in the form of companions.

### Server Requirements
- **Spigot** / **Paper** @ *1.8.x or Higher*
- Plugins
  - **Miniature Pets** @ *Latest*
  - **Citizens** @ *v2.0.x or Higher*

### Installation
1. Access your `plugins/` directory and place the `citizens-integration-x.x.jar` file inside the directory.
2. Reboot your server.

### Usage & Permissions
Being a completely seperate plugin, we though it could be less confusing to just include this in here.
- `/pet npc [title] [pet]` (*requires:* `miniaturepets.npc`)
  - This command spawns an NPC in the form of a pet. All interactions with the NPC are made through standard Citizens commands and not through Miniature Pets.
